# Machine-learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-project
Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence project report


In recent years of rapid machine learning growth, there have been
numerous robotics applications that leverage machine learning
algorithms as an alternative approach of robot control. Specifically,
Robot Manipulation is one sub area, where machine learning could be
applied for robust grasp of random objects. Improving the Quality of
Grasp will be essential in speed and efficiency of high-volume factory
automation. In this project, we are aiming to gain data-driven insights
from physical parameters of robot arms in a simulated environment.
Dataset of UR10 Robotic Arm states (Joint positions, velocities, and
torques) was produced from ROS Simulation in Gazebo (Smart
Grasping Sandbox). The Quality of grasp was measured as the
variation of distance between palm and object after grasp was
completed. The data was then trained on MLP, Random Forest, Light
GBM, and SVM algorithms with parameter optimization to identify the
optimal algorithm.


The goal of this project is to design machine
learning algorithm that accurately predicts
the quality of a robotic arm grasp. The
challenge of learning this dataset was
excessive number of features, large
dataset size, and explaineability of grasp
performance in terms of various features
